Upon locating the Citadel in 580 B.C., the asari would settle on the space colony with the assistance of the Keepers, eventually forming the Citadel Council when encountering the Salarians some decades later in 500 BC. Though lauded for their beautiful culture and exemplary diplomatic skills, the quick advancement of Asari technology is no accident: a Prothean beacon, which was concealed for centuries in the asari homeworld's Temple of Athame, was integral to the research and development of the asari's technology—a treasure that predates the Citadel Council law that it would eventually—secretly—violate. Thessia itself is home to vast reserves of the invaluable element zero, resulting in the asari evolving to be some of the most potent biotics throughout the galaxy.<br><br>The asari are unique among the Milky Way races for a number of reasons. First, and most notably, the asari are monogendered: though female-presenting to other races, the asari lack the sexual binary that is intrinsic to most races, and as a result, gendered language has little meaning to them. Secondly, the asari are able to reproduce with any race via parthenogenesis, which, in this case means that an asari is able to 'map' a partner's genetic makeup, which in turn is used to randomize the asari's own DNA to be passed on to their offspring. Though traits from the 'father' are often noticeable in terms of personality, the offspring will always be 100% asari. Lastly, the asari, aside from the krogan, are the longest-lived race both by lifespan as well as their race's endurance as a whole; the asari were the initial choice of the long-dead Protheans to lead the galaxy, while the race was still in its infancy.

Tensions were further exacerbated when humanity arrived on the scene, colonizing heavily in the south-southeastern portion of the galaxy—much of which intruded on Batarian space. This would lead to several conflicts between the races, culminating in the Skyllian Blitz of 2176 CE, which saw Batarian-led pirates and warlords attack the human colony of Elysium. The Blitz was doomed to fail, however, as well as the following conflict on Torfan, and the Batarians have remained resentful of humanity ever since. <br><br>What would have led to an inevitable all-out war between humanity and the Batarians over the destruction of the Alpha Relay, an effort to delay Reaper forces from an early siege that led to the loss of a nearby Batarian colony of 300,000 citizens, was cut brutally short by the first wave of Reaper invaders.

As a result of the Human Systems Alliance's success in the aforementioned conflict, the military superpower was elected to represent and govern humanity as a whole in Council Space.

The first of the Council races to become spacefarers and discover the Mass Relays. Upon locating the Citadel in 580 B.C., the asari would settle on the space colony with the assistance of the Keepers, eventually forming the Citadel Council when encountering the Salarians some decades later in 500 BC. Though lauded for their beautiful culture and exemplary diplomatic skills, the quick advancement of Asari technology is no accident: a Prothean beacon, which was concealed for centuries in the asari homeworld's Temple of Athame, was integral to the research and development of the asari's technology—a treasure that predates the Citadel Council law that it would eventually—secretly—violate. Thessia itself is home to vast reserves of the invaluable element zero, resulting in the asari evolving to be some of the most potent biotics throughout the galaxy.<br><br>The asari are unique among the Milky Way races for a number of reasons. First, and most notably, the asari are monogendered: though female-presenting to other races, the asari lack the sexual binary that is intrinsic to most races, and as a result, gendered language has little meaning to them. Secondly, the asari are able to reproduce with any race via parthenogenesis, which, in this case means that an asari is able to 'map' a partner's genetic makeup, which in turn is used to randomize the asari's own DNA to be passed on to their offspring. Though traits from the 'father' are often noticeable in terms of personality, the offspring will always be 100% asari. Lastly, the asari, aside from the krogan, are the longest-lived race both by lifespan as well as their race's endurance as a whole; the asari were the initial choice of the long-dead Protheans to lead the galaxy, while the race was still in its infancy. It helps that a single asari lifetime lasts an entire millennium as well.</p>"); break;

Little else is known about the Batarians, no doubt a result of the near-limitless propaganda put forth by their government, which boasts to its citizens and all who would listen that its economy rivals that of the Asari.<br><br>The Batarian Hegemony was already on the decline before the arrival of the Reapers; slavery, which the Hegemony claim as a vital aspect of their culture, has faced several sanctions by the Council, crippling their economy. Tensions were further exacerbated when humanity arrived on the scene, colonizing heavily in the south-southeastern portion of the galaxy—much of which intruded on Batarian space. This would lead to several conflicts between the races, culminating in the Skyllian Blitz of 2176 CE, which saw Batarian-led pirates and warlords attack the human colony of Elysium. The Blitz was doomed to fail, however, as well as the following conflict on Torfan, and the Batarians have remained resentful of humanity ever since.<br><br> What would have led to an inevitable all-out war between humanity and the Batarians over the destruction of the Alpha Relay, an effort to delay Reaper forces from an early siege that led to the loss of a nearby Batarian colony of 300,000 citizens, was cut brutally short by the first wave of Reaper invaders.

<p>Interested in a new multiplayer build? Running a campaign and you're looking for roleplaying inspiration? Then look no further! This quiz will help you determine what race and class from the sci-fi franchise Mass Effect you most resemble! </p>
<p>
 Please note that this quiz is constantly changing! Though its current incarnation may take no longer than five minutes, I plan to add additional races and questions at a later date!
<br><br>
 Lastly, this wouldn't have been possible without the creator of the D&D Character Quiz, who gave me permission to adapt his code for this project. Please go show them some support over at EasyDamus.com if you have a chance!. </p>

<p><b style="color:red;">PLEASE NOTE:</b> This test requires support for both JavaScript and pop-up windows.  If your browser doesn't support both of them, you're out of luck.  If you are not sure if your browser will work, scroll to the bottom and click on the "What Mass Effect Character Am I?" button to test before filling out all of the questions.</p>

<div id="abilityscores">
<hr /><p>
<a class="question">1. What statement would hurt you the most?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q41" value="1" type="radio" /> That I am a dishonorable person.<br /><br />
<input name="q41" value="2" type="radio" /> That I do not deserve to exist.<br /><br />
<input name="q41" value="3" type="radio" /> That I am an idiot.<br /><br />
<input name="q41" value="4" type="radio" /> That my body is more important than my mind or soul.<br /><br />
<input name="q41" value="5" type="radio" /> That I am not afraid to hurt other people to get what I want.<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">2. What is your most admirable quality?</a> <br /><br /><br />
<input name="q42" value="1" type="radio" /> I'm very resourceful when it comes to problem solving.<br /><br />
<input name="q42" value="2" type="radio" /> I never back down from a challenge.<br /><br />
<input name="q42" value="3" type="radio" /> There's very little I can't persuade other people to do.<br /><br />
<input name="q42" value="4" type="radio" /> I may not be very talented, but I'm a hard worker.<br /><br />
<input name="q42" value="5" type="radio" /> I'm the ultimate team player.<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">3. What would a potential partner likely value most about you at first glance?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q43" value="1" type="radio" /> My looks. I'm not ashamed to say that I'm physically above average.<br /><br />
<input name="q43" value="2" type="radio" /> My brains. Being an expert on something you care about is sexy!<br /><br />
<input name="q43" value="3" type="radio" /> My resources. Money can't buy you love, but it can definitely buy you options.<br /><br />
<input name="q43" value="4" type="radio" /> My devotion. Whether behind closed doors or in the trenches, I always give 100% of mysasari to others.<br /><br />
<input name="q43" value="5" type="radio" /> My mystique. The lack of the obvious is what draws others to want to know me.<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">4. What will be your most important legacy once you pass on?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q44" value="1" type="radio" /> My reputation. Above all else, I want people to remember me as I deserve.<br /><br />
<input name="q44" value="2" type="radio" /> My family. As long as the people I love don't forget me, I'll never really die.<br /><br />
<input name="q44" value="3" type="radio" /> My work. I don't want to leave the world the same as I found it.<br /><br />
<input name="q44" value="4" type="radio" /> My love. Everything else pales in comparison to the life I lived with my closest friend.<br /><br />
<input name="q44" value="5" type="radio" /> My growth. I'm far from perfect, but I've come a long way from where I was.<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">5. How would you define your romantic leaning?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q45" value="1" type="radio" /> Passive. I prefer or am used to being the recipient of affection.<br /><br />
<input name="q45" value="2" type="radio" /> Aggressive. I prefer or am used to initiating romance towards my prospects.<br /><br />
<input name="q45" value="3" type="radio" /> Inapplicable. I actively avoid romance.<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">6. What will be the last words you are likely to hear or say?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q46" value="1" type="radio" /> "You sold your soul to a path of blood."<br /><br />
<input name="q46" value="2" type="radio" /> "This soup tastes funny..."<br /><br />
<input name="q46" value="3" type="radio" /> "We cannot get out. They are coming."<br /><br />
<input name="q46" value="4" type="radio" /> "This is for my father!"<br /><br />
<input name="q46" value="5" type="radio" /> "It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">7. You find yourself the only pilot of a doomed space station. The station's failing mass effect core has been damaged in a recent raid, and if left unattended the structure will soon collide with a nearby moon, killing thousands of colonists. There are no functioning escape pods, and impact will occur in a matter of minutes. What will you do?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q47" value="1" type="radio" /> It all boils down to basic math. By detonating the core prior to impact, I will save thousands of lives. The only people who will die are those who would have been killed in the crash anyway.<br /><br />
<input name="q47" value="2" type="radio" /> I refuse to take any of the courses given to me and leave it to someone else. It isn't up to me to decide who lives or dies.<br /><br />
<input name="q47" value="3" type="radio" /> I let a coin flip decide my fate. I'm dead either way, and I have no reason to care for the lives of others whom I've never met.<br /><br />
<input name="q47" value="4" type="radio" /> We've only just entered the moon's atmosphere! If we work quickly, I can try to slow our descent while someone else contacts the local colony in hopes of evacuating as many people as possible. It's a risk, but I'd rather chance an all or nothing bet to save everyone than save no one.<br /><br />
<input name="q47" value="5" type="radio" /> Wait, isn't there a private luxury shuttle secured next to the captain's cabin? If I'm quick, I can make it out of here and no one will be the wiser...<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">8. Some time after rising through the ranks of your homeworld's most elite military unit, you find yourself nominated to join the Office of Special Tactics and Reconnaissance. Several weeks into your tenure as Spectre, you discover that a high-ranking official in your race's military hierarchy is engaging in highly illegal activities. It isn't possible that your superiors on the homeworld didn't know about this exchange, yet they've done little or nothing to stop this official. How do you proceed?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q48" value="1" type="radio" /> I appeal to my homeworld's leadership about the issue. I don't have all the facts and I owe my people's government the benefit of the doubt before taking this to the Council.<br /><br />
<input name="q48" value="2" type="radio" /> I take the issue before the Council. No matter what my shared history is with my people's military, my duty dictates that I answer to the highest authority.<br /><br />
<input name="q48" value="3" type="radio" /> I side with my people. My appointment as Spectre doesn't undo the years of mistreatment my race endured at the hands of the council.<br /><br />
<input name="q48" value="4" type="radio" /> I hold the intel as an ace up my sleeve. This information could jeopardize my people's place in galactic politics, which is exactly the kind of leverage I can use to gain even more influence.<br /><br />
<input name="q48" value="5" type="radio" /> I turn a blind eye. My people will always come first, and if the Council hasn't noticed after all this time, it obviously isn't hurting them.<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">9. What is your greatest fear?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q49" value="1" type="radio" /> Being alone for the rest of my life.<br /><br />
<input name="q49" value="2" type="radio" /> The world finding out my secrets.<br /><br />
<input name="q49" value="3" type="radio" /> Dying a painful, shameful death.<br /><br />
<input name="q49" value="4" type="radio" /> Everything that I've accomplished coming undone.<br /><br />
<input name="q49" value="5" type="radio" /> Losing the people I love.<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">10. If a fight were to break out, where would you be? </a> <br /><br />
<input name="q50" value="1" type="radio" /> Hauling ass in the opposite direction! <br /><br />
<input name="q50" value="2" type="radio" /> Providing support behind some of my beefier friends.<br /><br />
<input name="q50" value="3" type="radio" /> Charging into the fray, giving others an opportunity to take shelter.<br /><br />
<input name="q50" value="4" type="radio" /> Wherever the action is, laying down as much hurt as physically possible.<br /><br />
<input name="q50" value="5" type="radio" /> Trying to deescalate the situation, ideally from the sidelines.<br /><br />
<input name="q50" value="6" type="radio" /> In the midst of the crowd, sweeping people off their feet and causing mayhem.<br /><br />

</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">11. What was the first weapon you ever selected when exploring the Collector Ship?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q51" value="1" type="radio" /> The Revenant. There's nothing like mowing down hordes of enemies with impunity.<br /><br />
<input name="q51" value="2" type="radio" /> The Claymore. There are shotguns, and then there are machines of war that turn your foes into mist and bone.<br /><br />
<input name="q51" value="3" type="radio" /> The Widow. One shot, one overkill.<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">12. A horde of enemies is coming. Which battlefield do you choose to engage them on?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q52" value="1" type="radio" /> Open ground, with hastily-made barricades for shelter. We can annihilate them quickly by pointing and shooting down range.<br /><br />
<input name="q52" value="2" type="radio" /> An ambush! I'll place my soldiers at strategic sections around the battlefield, and massacre them once they step into our killbox.<br /><br />
<input name="q52" value="3" type="radio" /> We rush them! A few well-placed flash grenades, and my berserkers will tear them apart while they're lost in the confusion.<br /><br />
<input name="q52" value="4" type="radio" /> Dig in and kill 'em with bug bites. It may take longer, but by fortifying our positions and using specialized tools, we'll succeed without losing a single person.<br /><br />
<input name="q52" value="5" type="radio" /> Break them psychologically. I'll put the majority of our resources into one unkillable unit, and force the horde into an unwinnable situation.<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">13. It's been a rough day at work, and you just ordered takeout. What's on the menu?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q53" value="1" type="radio" /> Ramen! I hear it's a delicacy on Earth...<br /><br />
<input name="q53" value="2" type="radio" /> Varren steak. I like my meat with extra murder baked into it.<br /><br />
<input name="q53" value="3" type="radio" /> Asari calamari gumbo. Seems a little cannibalistic, but it goes great over rice.<br /><br />
<input name="q53" value="4" type="radio" /> Haggis. Even if most of it tastes like ass, I know a place that makes it taste like mighty <i>fine</i> ass.<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">14. The couple next door won't stop being obnoxiously loud during their nighttime activities. What do you put on to get them to quiet down?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q54" value="1" type="radio" /> "Barely Legal Elcor Heifer Bares All! 18 Hour Edition"<br /><br />
<input name="q54" value="2" type="radio" /> "Two Girls, One Emergency Induction Port"<br /><br />
<input name="q54" value="3" type="radio" /> "Skyllian Backroom Blitz: First Contact with these Rough Batarian Daddies"<br /><br />
<input name="q54" value="4" type="radio" />"DVDIS 06: This Voluptuous Volus Gets Stuck Halfway Through an Elevator—With Vorcha Construction Workers on Either Side!!" <br /><br />
<input name="q54" value="5" type="radio" /> "Tuchanka Twink 4: Shy Beefy Krogan Gets Bullied by Harem of Savage Salarians!"<br /><br />
</p><hr /><p>

<a class="question">15. What's one thing you've got to accomplish on your bucket list? </a> <br /><br />
<input name="q55" value="1" type="radio" /> I know they keep telling me it's a bad idea...but I've just GOT to lick a drell before I go. I don't care how bad the trip is.<br /><br />
<input name="q55" value="2" type="radio" /> By God, I'm either going to see what's under those asari tentacle-scalp things, or I'll die trying.<br /><br />
<input name="q55" value="3" type="radio" /> I don't know if I'd be the first to sleep with every sentient alien species, but I'm going to give it the old college try anyway.<br /><br />
<input name="q55" value="4" type="radio" /> Enough with all this war! I'm going on a tour of every homeworld I can find. Art, food, movies, music, culture—I want to see and know it all!<br /><br />

</p><hr />

<p>
<a class="question">16. A three-way gang war is taking place not too far from where you live. As a philanthropist with a vested interest in keeping casualities and damage at a minimum, an anonymous donation could tip the scales of the conflict. Who do you back?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q56" value="1" type="radio" /> The Eclipse. My money will assist their best operatives in assassinating the leaders of the other two groups, while their biotic troops and mechs will wreak havoc on their uncoordinated subordinates.<br /><br />
<input name="q56" value="2" type="radio" /> The Blood Pack. By pumping their soldiers full of steroids and experimental regenerative drugs, they'll be able to sweep over their enemies with sheer numbers and raw muscle.<br /><br />
<input name="q56" value="3" type="radio" /> The Blue Suns. They've a reputation for smuggling high-end weapons throughout the galaxy—my influence will help move things along for them, and end this conflict with unequaled firepower.<br /><br />

</p><hr />

<p>
<a class="question">17. When it comes to having a fatal flaw, yours is:</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q57" value="1" type="radio" /> Holding on to grudges.<br /><br />
<input name="q57" value="2" type="radio" /> Believing I can do things better than anyone else, without anyone else.<br /><br />
<input name="q57" value="3" type="radio" /> I don't know—or care—when to stop. <br /><br />
<input name="q57" value="4" type="radio" /> I'll step over people if it means getting ahead.<br /><br />
<input name="q57" value="5" type="radio" /> I can be passive to the point of harm—for myself as well as others.<br /><br />
</p><hr />

<p>
<a class="question">18. When dealing with enemies, it's better to:</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q58" value="1" type="radio" /> Remove any possibility of retaliation in the future.<br /><br />
<input name="q58" value="2" type="radio" /> Hold them to solemn oaths for the sake of peace.<br /><br />
<input name="q58" value="3" type="radio" /> Grind them into subservience; make victory work for you.<br /><br />
</p><hr />

<p>
<a class="question">19. You would rather be:</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q59" value="1" type="radio" /> Feared.<br /><br />
<input name="q59" value="2" type="radio" /> Respected.<br /><br />
</p><hr />

<p>
<a class="question">20. In combat, the most important trait is:</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q60" value="1" type="radio" /> To be faster.<br /><br />
<input name="q60" value="2" type="radio" /> To be stronger.<br /><br />
<input name="q60" value="3" type="radio" /> To be more resourceful.<br /><br />
<input name="q60" value="4" type="radio" /> To be adaptive in your thinking.<br /><br />
</p><hr />

<p>
<a class="question">21. For my height, I am considered:</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q61" value="1" type="radio" /> Thin.<br /><br />
<input name="q61" value="2" type="radio" /> Pretty average.<br /><br />
<input name="q61" value="3" type="radio" /> Solidly built.<br /><br />
<input name="q61" value="4" type="radio" /> Thick.<br /><br />
</p><hr />

<p>
<a class="question">22. As far as careers go, your ideal would be:</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q62" value="1" type="radio" /> To travel the galaxy and face dangerous foes as a mercenary.<br /><br />
<input name="q62" value="2" type="radio" /> To enlist in my homeworld's military and defend my people.<br /><br />
<input name="q62" value="3" type="radio" /> To be a diplomat, and meet with representatives from every race and enjoy their culture.<br /><br />
<input name="q62" value="4" type="radio" /> I'd like to do something creative, maybe with music, literature, or art, and see what the other races have to offer as well.<br /><br />
<input name="q62" value="5" type="radio" /> To be a scientist. Technology has advanced so much in the past few decades alone: I'd give anything to see how far we can keep going.<br /><br />
</p><hr />

<p>
<a class="question">23. The Citadel Council has made some extreme military choices in the past, including near-genocide. Do you think these actions were justified?</a> <br /><br />

</p><hr />

<input name="q66" value="1" type="radio" /> Aren't stand-ins for morality or common sense.<br /><br />
<input name="q66" value="2" type="radio" /> Are there to protect us.<br /><br />
<input name="q66" value="3" type="radio" /> Are subjective based on culture and values.<br /><br />

</p><hr />

<p>

<input name="q67" value="4" type="radio" /> My ability to tell what others wanted or needed without being told.<br /><br />
</p><hr />

<p>
<a class="question">28. When it comes to handling assignments...</a> <br /><br />

</p><hr />

</p><hr />

<p>
<a class="question">30. The most valuable tool when it comes to problem solving has to be...</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q70" value="1" type="radio" /> Being able to entertain multiple solutions or perspectives.<br /><br />

<input name="q70" value="3" type="radio" /> Showing intiative by resolving the problem quickly and taking the most direct path.<br /><br />
</p><hr />

<p>

<input name="q71" value="1" type="radio" /> With the Batarian Hegemony all but extinct, a major power player for the slave trade is out of commission. I'm going to spearhead the effort to eliminate slavery from the Milky Way Galaxy.<br /><br />
<input name="q71" value="2" type="radio" /> The Reapers scoured countless worlds, leaving vast areas devoid of influence and management. With this power vacuum, the real estate market will be lucrative...with my help in balancing the scales.<br /><br />
<input name="q71" value="3" type="radio" /> The war was devasting for the mercenary scene, but it did wonders for unifying the races. With the hierarchy of the Blue Suns, Eclipse, and Blood Pack in shambles, now is the time to forge a new organization from the remnants. With veteran members from each of the surviving races, we will be a political and military force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />
<input name="q71" value="4" type="radio" /> Relative harmony among the races has been established due to a common enemy in the Reapers, but we have to work to secure them to keep from repeating the same mistakes. The Genophage, batarian and human conflicts in the Traverse, drell underpopulation, working with old enemies in the Geth and Rachni...there's a lot of work to be done before peace is a mainstay.<br /><br />
</p><hr />

<input name="q72" value="3" type="radio" /> A mighty halberd. By positioning myself correctly, I can funnel my enemies into a manageable line. The work may be rote and monotonous, but by digging in I will be safe.<br /><br />
</p><hr />

<p>
<a class="question">33. Your platoon is under a surprise attack! Luckily you thought to rest in your armor, but you have only a few seconds to find something to defend yourself with before you are overwhelmed by enemies; what do you grab?</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q73" value="1" type="radio" /> My shield boosters. I can outlast my opponents in almost any situation with them.<br /><br />
<input name="q73" value="2" type="radio" /> My biotic amp. It may give me some fierce migraines, but this handy piece of wetware will let me rip my enemies apart with nothing but my mind.<br /><br />
<input name="q73" value="3" type="radio" /> My omni-tool kit. Something tells me I'm going to overclocking it for the foreseeable future, and I don't want my best resource to break down on me.<br /><br />

</p><hr />

<p>
<a class="question">35. It's the courtroom scandal of the century, and you're the defendant! You're being brought before the Citadel's grand jury on account of:</a> <br /><br />
<input name="q76" value="1" type="radio" /> Insider trading. Either someone blabbed, or one of my peers has it out for me.<br /><br />
<input name="q76" value="2" type="radio" /> Accusations of war crimes! I'm so angry, I could glass a colony!<br /><br />
<input name="q76" value="3" type="radio" /> I may have started a cult or two!<br /><br />
<input name="q76" value="4" type="radio" /> What do you mean it's called slavery?!<br /><br />
