This quiz is a rudimentary project using custom CSS and code borrowed and adapted from the D&D alignment quiz on EasyDamus. It is a passion project of mine designed to do two things: tell the user what race from the sci-fi franchise Mass Effect their answers would make them out to be, as well as which of the six classes they would most align with.

Races: Human, Asari, Turian, Salarian, Volus, Quarian, Krogan, Batarian, Geth, Rachni

Possible future races: Vorcha, Elcor, Drell, Hanar

Classes: Soldier, Adept, Engineer, Vangaurd, Infiltrator, Sentinel

The code and values are being balanced to include equal chances of any one result being equally possible compared to the others. If you see any reference to the previous quiz such as alignment values or deities, just know that widespread removal generally resulted in the quiz failing to work, and as a result it's being left alone for now.

Future goals include custom CSS for the submit button (that doesn't result in the page being refreshed), more elegant CSS for the header links, background music, a comment section, and transitions for questions instead of scrolling. Unfortunately, these options are limited as I am running off of a semester of coding from 6 years ago, and so progress may be slow. My PHP is especially rusty.
